This data protection declaration also applies to our websites and social media profiles. For the definition of terms such as \"personal data\" or \"processing\", please refer to Art. 4 GDPR.</p><strong>Name and contact details of the person responsible</strong><br />Our person responsible (hereinafter \"person responsible\") within the meaning of Art. 4 no. 7 GDPR is:<br /><br />Johannes Müller<br />Simone-Veil-Straße 30<br />Bonn<br />Managing Director: Johannes Müller<br />E-mail address: jm.tech.info00@gmail.com<br /><br /><strong>Data types, purposes of processing and categories of persons affected</strong><br /><p>Below we will inform you about the type, scope and purpose of the collection, processing and use of personal data.</p><strong>1.

Should this be the case, then the data will be passed on on the basis of the legal bases mentioned above, e.g. when data is passed on to online payment providers to fulfill the contract or due to a court order or due to a legal obligation to release the data for the purposes of criminal prosecution, to avert danger or to enforce intellectual property rights.<br />We also use processors (external service providers, e.g. for web hosting our websites and databases) to process your data. If data is passed on to the processors as part of an order processing agreement, this is always done in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR. We select our processors carefully, monitor them regularly and have been granted the right to give instructions regarding the data.

Your data will therefore primarily be processed by companies to which the GDPR applies. Should processing take place by third-party services outside the European Union or the European Economic Area, these must meet the special requirements of Art. 44 ff. GDPR. This means that the processing is carried out on the basis of special guarantees, such as the officially recognised determination by the EU Commission of a level of data protection corresponding to that of the EU or the observance of officially recognised special contractual obligations, the so-called \"standard contractual clauses\".<br />If we obtain your express consent to the transfer of data to the USA due to the ineffectiveness of the so-called \"Privacy Shield\", in accordance with Art. 49 Para. 1 Clause 1 Letter a) of GDPR, we point out the risk of secret access by US authorities and the use of the data for surveillance purposes, possibly without legal remedies for EU citizens.</p><br /><strong>Deletion of data and storage period</strong><p>Unless expressly stated in this data protection declaration, your personal data will be deleted or blocked as soon as you revoke the consent given for processing or the purpose for storage no longer applies or the data is no longer required for the purpose, unless its further storage is necessary for evidentiary purposes or the are contrary to statutory retention periods. These include, for example, commercial retention periods for business letters according to Section 257 Para. 1 HGB (6 years) and tax retention periods for documents according to Section 147 Para. 1 AO (10 years). When the prescribed retention period expires, your data will be blocked or deleted unless storage is still required to conclude or fulfill a contract.</p><br/><strong>Existence of automated decision-making</strong><p>We do not use automated decision-making or profiling.</p><br/><strong>Provision of our website and creation of log files</strong><ol style=\"margin:10px 0px; padding:15px;\"><li>If you only use our website for information purposes (i.e. no registration or other transmission of information), we only collect the personal data that your browser transmits to our server.
